# Hello-world

Hello, my name is Fatima Viola. I am so exited about learning to code! I am already in love with the octocat. I am going to order the figurine, so it can live on my desk and bless my code. 
An invocation to Octocat:
"Bless me O'Octocat. May my knowlege of stacks be full, my wifi swift, and my codes bug free. Amen"
